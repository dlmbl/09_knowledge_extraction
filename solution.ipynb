    "# Exercise 8: Knowledge Extraction from a Pre-trained Neural Network\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this exercise is to learn how to probe what a pre-trained classifier has learned about the data it was trained on.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be working with a simple example which is a fun derivation on the MNIST dataset that you will have seen in previous exercises in this course.\n",
    "Unlike regular MNIST, our dataset is classified not by number, but by color!\n",
    "\n",
    "We will:\n",
    "1. Load a pre-trained classifier and try applying conventional attribution methods\n",
    "2. Train a GAN to create counterfactual images - translating images from one class to another\n",
    "3. Evaluate the GAN - see how good it is at fooling the classifier\n",
    "4. Create attributions from the counterfactual, and learn the differences between the classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "If time permits, we will try to apply this all over again as a bonus exercise to a much more complex and more biologically relevant problem.\n",

    "    * (easy) Data augmentation: The training code for the classifier is quite simple in this example. Enlarge the amount of available training data by adding augmentations (transpose and mirror the images, add noise, change the intensity, etc.).\n",
    "    * (easy) Network architecture: The VGG network has a few parameters that one can tune. Try a few to see what difference it makes.\n",
    "    * (easy) Inspect the classifier predictions: Take random samples from the test dataset and classify them. Show the images together with their predicted and actual labels.\n",
    "    * (medium) Other networks:  Try different architectures (e.g., a [ResNet](https://blog.paperspace.com/writing-resnet-from-scratch-in-pytorch/#resnet-from-scratch)) and see if the accuracy can be improved.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Explore the CycleGAN.\n",
    "    * (easy) The example code below shows how to translate between GABA and acetylcholine. Try different combinations. Can you start to see differences between some pairs of classes? Which are the ones where the differences are the most or the least obvious? Can you see any differences that aren't well described by the mask? How would you describe these?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Try on your own data!\n",
    "    * Have a look at how the synapse images are organized in `data/raw/synapses`. Copy the directory structure and use your own images. Depending on your data, you might have to adjust the image size (128x128 for the synapses) and number of channels in the VGG network and CycleGAN code."
