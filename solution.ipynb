    "# Exercise 8: Knowledge Extraction from a Pre-trained Neural Network\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this exercise is to learn how to probe what a pre-trained classifier has learned about the data it was trained on.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be working with a simple example which is a fun derivation on the MNIST dataset that you will have seen in previous exercises in this course.\n",
    "Unlike regular MNIST, our dataset is classified not by number, but by color!\n",
    "\n",
    "We will:\n",
    "1. Load a pre-trained classifier and try applying conventional attribution methods\n",
    "2. Train a GAN to create counterfactual images - translating images from one class to another\n",
    "3. Evaluate the GAN - see how good it is at fooling the classifier\n",
    "4. Create attributions from the counterfactual, and learn the differences between the classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "If time permits, we will try to apply this all over again as a bonus exercise to a much more complex and more biologically relevant problem.\n",
    "### Acknowledgments\n",
